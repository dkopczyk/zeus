However, as you lower the GPU's frequency, both time and energy will start to inflate after some point. In other words, those frequencies take more time and energy and are simply inefficient (i.e., Pareto-suboptimal), so we won't be running anything with those frequencies. Therefore, you actually don't need to profile time and energy for every frequency.

This is possible because the Zeus daemon supports a <code>block: bool</code> parameter in HTTP requests, which can be set to <code>False</code> to make the call return immediately without checking the result.</p>"},{"location":"reference/device/gpu/#zeus.device.gpu--error-handling","title":"Error handling","text":"<p>The following exceptions are defined in this module:</p> <ul> <li><code>ZeusGPUInitError</code>: Base class for initialization errors.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUInvalidArgError</code>: Error for invalid arguments.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUNotSupportedError</code>: Error for unsupported GPUs.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUNoPermissionError</code>: Error for permission issues.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUAlreadyInitializedError</code>: Error for reinitialization.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUNotFoundError</code>: Error for missing GPUs.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUInsufficientSizeError</code>: Error for insufficient buffer size.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUInsufficientPowerError</code>: Error for insufficient power.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUDriverNotLoadedError</code>: Error for driver issues.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUTimeoutError</code>: Error for timeout issues.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUIRQError</code>: Error for IRQ issues.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPULibraryNotFoundError</code>: Error for missing libraries.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUFunctionNotFoundError</code>: Error for missing functions.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUCorruptedInfoROMError</code>: Error for corrupted info ROM.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPULostError</code>: Error for lost GPUs.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUResetRequiredError</code>: Error for GPUs requiring reset.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUOperatingSystemError</code>: Error for OS issues.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPULibRMVersionMismatchError</code>: Error for library version mismatch.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUMemoryError</code>: Error for memory issues.</li> <li><code>ZeusGPUUnknownError</code>: Error for unknown issues.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"reference/device/gpu/#zeus.device.gpu.ZeusBaseGPUError","title":"ZeusBaseGPUError","text":"<p>               Bases: <code>ZeusBaseError</code></p> <p>Zeus base GPU exception class.</p> Source code in <code>zeus/device/exception.py</code> <pre><code>class ZeusBaseGPUError(ZeusBaseError):\n    \"\"\"Zeus base GPU exception class.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, message: str) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"Initialize Base Zeus Exception.\"\"\"\n        super().__init__(message)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/device/gpu/#zeus.device.gpu.ZeusBaseGPUError.__init__","title":"__init__","text":"<pre><code>__init__(message)\n</code></pre> Source code in <code>zeus/device/exception.py</code> <pre><code>def __init__(self, message: str) -&gt; None:\n    \"\"\"Initialize Base Zeus Exception.\"\"\"\n    super().__init__(message)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/device/gpu/#zeus.device.gpu.GPU","title":"GPU","text":"<p>               Bases: <code>ABC</code></p> <p>Abstract base class for managing one GPU.</p> <p>For each method, child classes should call into vendor-specific GPU management libraries (e.g., NVML for NVIDIA GPUs).</p> Source code in <code>zeus/device/gpu/common.py</code> <pre><code>class GPU(abc.ABC):\n    \"\"\"Abstract base class for managing one GPU.\n\n    For each method, child classes should call into vendor-specific\n    GPU management libraries (e.g., NVML for NVIDIA GPUs).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, gpu_index: int) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"Initializ the GPU with a specified index.\"\"\"\n        self.gpu_index = gpu_index\n\n    @property\n    @abc.abstractmethod\n    def supports_nonblocking_setters(self) -&gt; bool:\n        \"\"\"Return True if the GPU object supports non-blocking configuration setters.\"\"\"\n        return False\n\n    @abc.abstractmethod\n    def getName(self) -&gt; str:\n        \"\"\"Return the name of the GPU model.\"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    @abc.abstractmethod\n    def getPowerManagementLimitConstraints(self) -&gt; tuple[int, int]:\n        \"\"\"Return the minimum and maximum power management limits.

This is a workaround to the lack of a direct API for\n        synchronizing computations on JAX devices. Tracking issue:\n        https://github.com/google/jax/issues/4335\n\n    !!! Note\n        Across the Zeus library, an integer device index corresponds to a single whole\n        physical device. This is usually what you want, except when using more advanced\n        device partitioning (e.g., using `--xla_force_host_platform_device_count` in JAX\n        to partition CPUs into more pieces). In such cases, you probably want to opt out\n        from using this function and handle synchronization manually at the appropriate\n        granularity.\n\n    Args:\n        gpu_devices: GPU device indices to synchronize.\n        sync_with: Deep learning framework to use to synchronize computations.\n            Defaults to `\"torch\"`, in which case `torch.cuda.synchronize` will be used.\n    \"\"\"\n    if sync_with == \"torch\" and torch_is_available(ensure_available=True):\n        torch = MODULE_CACHE[\"torch\"]\n        for device in gpu_devices:\n            torch.cuda.synchronize(device)\n        return\n\n    if sync_with == \"jax\" and jax_is_available(ensure_available=True):\n        jax = MODULE_CACHE[\"jax\"]\n        futures = [\n            jax.device_put(0.0, device=jax.devices(\"gpu\")[device]) + 0\n            for device in gpu_devices\n        ]\n        futures.append(jax.device_put(0.0, device=jax.devices(\"cpu\")[0]) + 0)\n        jax.block_until_ready(futures)\n        return\n\n    raise RuntimeError(\"No framework is available.\")\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"reference/utils/logging/","title":"logging","text":""},{"location":"reference/utils/logging/#zeus.utils.logging","title":"zeus.utils.logging","text":"<p>Utilities for logging.</p>"},{"location":"reference/utils/logging/#zeus.utils.logging.FileAndConsole","title":"FileAndConsole","text":"<p>Like tee, but for Python prints.</p> Source code in <code>zeus/utils/logging.py</code> <pre><code>class FileAndConsole:\n    \"\"\"Like tee, but for Python prints.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, filepath: Path) -&gt;
